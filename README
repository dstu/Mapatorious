Building and running are with
"Leiningen":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen. We use
"Penumbra":http://github.com/ztellman/penumbra for
Clojure-native OpenGL work. We target Penumbra 0.6 and Clojure
1.2. Leiningen should automagically handle all the dependencies
for you.

Resolve dependencies:

lein deps
lein native-deps

Open up a REPL and require some of the test packages to see how
they work:

lein repl
(require 'some.test)

Check the project.clj and Google for Leiningen settings for
build configuration options.
