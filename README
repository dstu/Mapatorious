Building is with Maven 2. We use Penumbra for Clojure-native
OpenGL work.

You'll need to get Penumbra. Penumbra uses Leiningen to
build. Get Leiningen:

cd ~/bin
wget http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein
chmod +x lein
lein self-install

We're targeting Clojure 1.1 for now, so we need to use the 0.5.0
branch of Penumbra:

git clone http://github.com/ztellman/penumbra.git
cd penumbra
git checkout -b 0.5.0 origin/0.5.0
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein install
lein test

This will get all the dependencies of Penumbra and should show
some or all of the Penumbra demos. (Close the windows that "lein
test" opens using your window manager to dismiss them.)

Since our own code is still being managed with Maven, use it to
build and run our project.

Compile:

mvn compile

Run:

mvn clojure:run

Check the pom.xml and Google for Maven settings for build
configuration options.
