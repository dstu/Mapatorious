Use lein 1.2. Other versions are broken.

Building is with Maven 2. We use Penumbra for Clojure-native
OpenGL work. We target Penumbra 0.6 and Clojure 1.2. Maven
should automagically handle all the dependencies for you.

Compile:

mvn compile

Run:

mvn clojure:run

Open a REPL:

mvn clojure:repl

Check the pom.xml and Google for Maven settings for build
configuration options.

This hasn't been tested with code that really uses Penumbra. If
you have problems with Penumbra, you'll need to install it
yourself. Penumbra uses Leiningen to build. Get Leiningen:

cd ~/bin
wget http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/master/bin/lein
chmod +x lein
lein self-install

Next, install Penumbra:

git clone http://github.com/ztellman/penumbra.git
cd penumbra
lein deps
lein native-deps
lein install
